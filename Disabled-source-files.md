Gustav provides the ability to disable [source files](Source-files). A [destination file](Destination-files) for a source files that was generated **before** the source file has been disabled is still accessible, unless it is deleted. After a source file has been disabled no more destination files can be created for that source file until it is enabled again.  
Moreover disabled source files are *not taken into account* when choosing a matching source file for [automatically generating a destination file](Automatic-generation-of-destination-files).  
Furthermore disabled source files doesn't appear in the results of [`Gustav::query()`](Public-API%3a-Gustav#string-query--stringstring-src_directory----bool-recursive--true--arraynull-filters--null--int-filters_operator--gustavfilter_and--int-order_by--gustavorder_pub--int-min_match_score--0--bool-include_disabled--false--include_hidden_directory--false--) by default. This also affectes [`Gustav::getTags()`](Public-API%3a-Gustav#int-gettags) and [`Gustav::getCategories()`](Public-API%3a-Gustav#array-getcategories).

Source files are disabled by prepending a `_` to the filename. A source file with the filename (without file-extension) `_` is not considered to be disabled, at least one more character must follow the `_`.
